## Summary

"Runwea" is a Weather Application built with React that judges weather or not it is the best time to run currently. Using the OpenWeather API, a standard search bar and utilizes geolocation to get the most accurate results.

## Inspiration

I'm an runner, that runs quite a bit. Now many of us (me in my early years) running don't care about how the weather is out side or think we can just slap on a bit of sunscreen and we will be both protected and perform at our very best. Sometimes, that isn't the case, so I  made this little thing that will be expanded into something that'll actually help us run at our very best, when it's best outside so we can push ourselves with weather being the smallest factor against our performance.

I wanted to make something with no bootstrap, rare use of fontawesome and showcase stuff I can make from scratch (See those nifty icons? Me. Paint.NET.)

## Challenges

Came out of BootCamp right before I started the project, I took 2-3 weeks relearning what I learned, I believe we learn better on our own and don't copy along. So being exactly 5 months into coding and being knowledge dumped of all of these cool concepts and practices it was rough for me to create this and stay on a schedule with React because I ran into issues of course new people would make. I wasn't discouraged, I've lost days to the simplest of errors but I'm learning, and now to think about it, all the errors I got are pretty silly now. 

## Technologies

1. React(w/ Hooks!)
2. Openweather API
3. MomentJS
4. CSS3 Flexbox & Grid
5. More will be used when I expand!

## How To Use

1. Allow your browser to enable Geo-Location.
2. An alternative is to use only your city name, this will be fixed where you can search by the city with state or nation.

## The Future

I intend on releasing this for free (On Google Play) to have something on my name and say that I did it. But several things have to be done first.

<b>Fixes</b>: Too many. 

<b>Major Features Planned</b>:

1) Run Checker - User checks the block a logs in the day if they ran for the day or not, they'll be able to log miles too.

2) Run Status - After user checks the block for the day, the information displays of the last week, green boxes if ran, red if they didn't.

3) In Depth Forecast - Each day would have a status, if the user clicks on that day, there would be an hourly update of that day selected, for the user to find out what best hours to run in.

4) The Backend - A user/sign up page Save total user mileage, create a default or list of areas for quick searching. Still thinking this one through.
